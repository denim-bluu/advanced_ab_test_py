## Scope

TBD

## Structure

TBD

## Github

### Branching Guideline

The branching structure in this development pipeline follows the branch-structure described in this page: [Branching](https://gist.github.com/digitaljhelms/4287848)
### Commit Convention

The commit convention is well described in this page: [Conventional Commit Messages](https://gist.github.com/qoomon/5dfcdf8eec66a051ecd85625518cfd13#types)

### Python Virtual Environment Setting

#### Build your virtual environment and install all packages

Run shell-script with Makefile

```zsh
make setup_venv
```

Or manually create a virtual environment with Python version ^3.10 and install all packages via `poetry`.
## Formatting (Preferred)

### Black formatting

All code in this repository should be `Black` formatted. Black is a very useful tool for formatting, it makes code review faster by producing the smallest diffs possible.
Blackened code looks the same regardless of the project youâ€™re reading. Formatting becomes transparent after a while and you can focus on the content instead.
More on this here <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>.

Using Github actions (setup in black.yml) all code PRs are tested for black formatting to ensure consistency across the repo

## Pre-Commit (Optional)

[Git pre-commit hook](<(https://pre-commit.com/)>) feature is implemented to ensure that the repository is maintained
with consistent manner and automatically flag undetected errors & issues prior to code commit

### Installation

Prior to running hooks, need to install:

```zsh
pip install pre-commit
```

### Define pre-commit config file

Configuration file is needed to specify hook plugins that you want to add.
If you don't have any configuration file, then add `.pre-commit-config.yaml` in the root
repository. Once you have defined your hooks in the config file, they will run automatically
every time you commit

### Adding additional hook plugins

If you want to add additional hook plugins, simply add hook in `.pre-commit-config,yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v4.0.1
    hooks:
      - id: trailing-whitespace
      - id: check-json
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
      - id: name-tests-test
      - id: requirements-txt-fixer

  - repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    rev: 19.3b0
    hooks:
      - id: black
```

Here is the link to the support hooks [Link](https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html)

### Install git hook scripts

run `pre-commit install` to set up the git hook scripts

```zsh
pre-commit install
```

### (Option) Run against all files

If you want to run pre-commit hook checks on all files in the project, type:

```zsh
pre-commit run --all-files
```

This code will run all pre-commit checks.

## Test Driven Development (Optional)

### pyest

pytest is one of the best tools for effective TDD framework.
Compared to built-in tool **unittest** module, pytest provides handful features that
could potentially enhance the TDD framework.

For detailed implementation of PyTest, please refer to the PyTest
[website](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/).

### Implementation

Currently, pytest is amalgamated with Git Action so that it is invoked everytime the user
push or PR to the repository. The relevant Git Action YAML file is located
[here](.github/workflows/tests.yml).

If you want to invoke pytest locally, please refer to the quick examples below.
(For further details, please refer to the website)

### How to invoke pytest

Run tests in a module:

```zsh
pytest tests/unittest/testing_file.py
```

Run tests in a directory:

```zsh
pytest tests/unittest/
```

Run all tests (From root directory):

```zsh
pytest .
```
